Simple backup util - stores backups as copies, using rsync

Tries to be ok att managing backups using the directory layout of
the source file/dir.


Be careful!


copyback is a shell script, that relies heavily on the
 - OS environment
 - command line utilities
 - syntax of file names

copyback is tested by a program (simptest), which is also written
in shell script.

Neither copyback itself or the tests are portable!

Tested on Ubuntu Linux. Bash v4.3.


copyback was developed while learning shell script (around 2007).
