# Tests deriving the backup destination.
#
# The destination is bak-dir.
# The destination must exist.
#
# Fails because the destination is a copyback backup directory.
#
# Note: This test will fail if the current directory for simptestcase (or simptest)
#       is not the realpath of that directory.  What this means that the name of the
#       current directory cannot contain symbolic links.
#
# Uses m4 preprocessing.
